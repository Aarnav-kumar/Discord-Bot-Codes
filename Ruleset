Repository Ruleset

this is not a legally applicable license as it is typed by me over here,
but this file basically lays down rules you agreed to cooperate to IF you
somehow use this repository in your codes in any way, type or form.

RULES:
1. this is a repository i store open-source codes from other random coders.
2. the code may or may not be mine, so don't go putting your nametags around here.
3. the codes here may be totally complete or just a snippet of something, you
   can go ahead and build/modify them to your needs.
4. also if you want your creations to be here, please don't hesitate to message me on discord.

Upload rules and acknowledgement
1. if you are a dev who wants to upload their code snippets or code files, you must acknowledge the below rules.
2. your code Could be used by people you don't know.
3. if you are the person who wants the code, just copy-paste it in your editor and start modifying it to your needs
4. for the devs here, all snippet must be 'Safe For Work'


ONE FINAL IMPORTANT RULE: APPLIES TO ALL (devs or users)
-every code snippet uploaded here shall be dedicated to bot making people of discord,
 any code found to be from a different topic (a piece of code for 'hello world' instead of a 
code snippet that helps banning users on discord), will be removed if found

anything else that is not included in this ruleset will be considered okay
:)
